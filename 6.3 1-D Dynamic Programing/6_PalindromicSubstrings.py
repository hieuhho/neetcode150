# Palindromic Substrings
# Solved

# Given a string s, return the number of substrings within s that are palindromes.

# A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abc"

# Output: 3

# Explanation: "a", "b", "c".

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "aaa"

# Output: 6

# Explanation: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa". Note that different substrings are counted as different palindromes even if the string contents are the same.

# Constraints:

#     1 <= s.length <= 1000
#     s consists of lowercase English letters.
