# Hand of Straights

# You are given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize.

# You want to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and card values are consecutively increasing by 1.

# Return true if it's possible to rearrange the cards in this way, otherwise, return false.

# Example 1:

# Input: hand = [1,2,4,2,3,5,3,4], groupSize = 4

# Output: true

# Explanation: The cards can be rearranged as [1,2,3,4] and [2,3,4,5].

# Example 2:

# Input: hand = [1,2,3,3,4,5,6,7], groupSize = 4

# Output: false

# Explanation: The closest we can get is [1,2,3,4] and [3,5,6,7], but the cards in the second group are not consecutive.

# Constraints:

#     1 <= hand.length <= 1000
#     0 <= hand[i] <= 1000
#     1 <= groupSize <= hand.length

class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], groupSize: int) -> bool:
        if len(hand) % groupSize: return False
        freq = {}
        for card in hand:
            freq[card] = freq.get(card, 0) + 1

        hand.sort()

        for card in hand:
            if freq[card]:
                for i in range(card, card + groupSize):
                    if not freq.get(i):
                        return False
                    freq[i] -= 1
        return True
