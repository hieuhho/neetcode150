# N-Queens
# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other.

# A queen in a chessboard can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

# Each solution contains a unique board layout where the queen pieces are placed. 'Q' indicates a queen and '.' indicates an empty space.

# You may return the answer in any order.

# Example 1:



# Input: n = 4

# Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
# Explanation: There are two different solutions to the 4-queens puzzle.

# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1

# Output: [["Q"]]
# Constraints:

# 1 <= n <= 8
